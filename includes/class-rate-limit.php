 * Attempt counting that a burst of parallel requests cannot outrun.

 * The obvious implementation, read the count and write back one more, is not
 * atomic: fire fifty guesses at once and every one of them reads the same number
 * and writes the same number back, so the counter advances by one and the real
 * ceiling becomes however many requests an attacker can make at the same
 * moment. Claiming the challenge token bounds one token to one guess, but
 * nothing bounds how many tokens somebody with the password can mint, so that
 * alone does not close it.
 *
 * The count therefore lives in a table with a primary key, and every attempt is
 * reserved by a single statement that increments and returns the new value.
 * Whoever asks for the sixth attempt is told it is the sixth, whatever else is
 * happening at the same time.
